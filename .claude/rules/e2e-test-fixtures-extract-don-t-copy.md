## E2E test fixtures: extract, don't copy

**NEVER copy a full SKILL.md file into an E2E test fixture.** SKILL.md files are
1500-2000 lines. When `claude -p` reads a file that large, context bloat causes
timeouts, flaky turn limits, and tests that take 5-10x longer than necessary.

Instead, extract only the section the test actually needs:

```typescript
// BAD — agent reads 1900 lines, burns tokens on irrelevant sections
fs.copyFileSync(path.join(ROOT, 'ship', 'SKILL.md'), path.join(dir, 'ship-SKILL.md'));

// GOOD — agent reads ~60 lines, finishes in 38s instead of timing out
const full = fs.readFileSync(path.join(ROOT, 'ship', 'SKILL.md'), 'utf-8');
const start = full.indexOf('## Review Readiness Dashboard');
const end = full.indexOf('\n---\n', start);
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(dir, 'ship-SKILL.md'), full.slice(start, end > start ? end : undefined));
```

Also when running targeted E2E tests to debug failures:
- Run in **foreground** (`bun test ...`), not background with `&` and `tee`
- Never `pkill` running eval processes and restart — you lose results and waste money
- One clean run beats three killed-and-restarted runs
