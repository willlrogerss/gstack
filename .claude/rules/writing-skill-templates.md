## Writing SKILL templates

SKILL.md.tmpl files are **prompt templates read by Claude**, not bash scripts.
Each bash code block runs in a separate shell — variables do not persist between blocks.

Rules:
- **Use natural language for logic and state.** Don't use shell variables to pass
  state between code blocks. Instead, tell Claude what to remember and reference
  it in prose (e.g., "the base branch detected in Step 0").
- **Don't hardcode branch names.** Detect `main`/`master`/etc dynamically via
  `gh pr view` or `gh repo view`. Use `{{BASE_BRANCH_DETECT}}` for PR-targeting
  skills. Use "the base branch" in prose, `<base>` in code block placeholders.
- **Keep bash blocks self-contained.** Each code block should work independently.
  If a block needs context from a previous step, restate it in the prose above.
- **Express conditionals as English.** Instead of nested `if/elif/else` in bash,
  write numbered decision steps: "1. If X, do Y. 2. Otherwise, do Z."
