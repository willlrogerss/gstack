## Browser interaction

When you need to interact with a browser (QA, dogfooding, cookie setup), use the
`/browse` skill or run the browse binary directly via `$B <command>`. NEVER use
`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools — they are slow, unreliable, and not what this
project uses.

**Sidebar architecture:** Before modifying `sidepanel.js`, `background.js`,
`content.js`, `terminal-agent.ts`, or sidebar-related server endpoints,
read `docs/designs/SIDEBAR_MESSAGE_FLOW.md`. The sidebar has one primary
surface — the **Terminal** pane (interactive `claude` PTY) — with
Activity / Refs / Inspector as debug overlays behind the footer's
`debug` toggle. The chat queue path was ripped once the PTY proved out;
`sidebar-agent.ts` and the `/sidebar-command` / `/sidebar-chat` /
`/sidebar-agent/event` endpoints are gone. The doc covers the WS auth
flow, dual-token model, and threat-model boundary — silent failures
here usually trace to not understanding the cross-component flow.

**Embedder terminal-agent ownership** (v1.42.1.0+, identity-based kill v1.44.0.0+).
`buildFetchHandler` in `browse/src/server.ts` accepts `ServerConfig.ownsTerminalAgent?:
boolean` (default `true`). When `true`, factory shutdown runs the full teardown:
identity-based kill via `killAgentByRecord(readAgentRecord(stateDir))` from
`browse/src/terminal-agent-control.ts` plus `safeUnlinkQuiet` on
`<stateDir>/terminal-port`, `<stateDir>/terminal-internal-token`, and
`<stateDir>/terminal-agent-pid` (the per-boot agent record introduced in v1.44).
Embedders (e.g. the gbrowser phoenix overlay) that pre-launch their own PTY
server must pass `false` so their discovery files survive gstack teardown cycles.
The flag is the third caller-owned teardown gate in `ServerConfig` (alongside
`xvfb?` and `proxyBridge?`); polarity is inverted (explicit bool vs presence) and
documented in the field's JSDoc. CLI `start()` always passes `true` explicitly —
the static-grep test in `browse/test/server-embedder-terminal-port.test.ts` fails
CI if a refactor drops it. Pre-v1.44 used `pkill -f terminal-agent\.ts` (regex
match) which would kill sibling gstack sessions on the same host; the new
`browse/test/terminal-agent-pid-identity.test.ts` static-grep tripwire fails CI
if any source file re-introduces `pkill ... terminal-agent` or `spawnSync('pkill', ...)`.

**WebSocket auth uses Sec-WebSocket-Protocol, not cookies.** Browsers
can't set `Authorization` on a WebSocket upgrade, but they CAN set
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` via `new WebSocket(url, [token])`. The agent
reads it, validates against `validTokens`, and MUST echo the protocol
back in the upgrade response — without the echo, Chromium closes the
connection immediately. `Set-Cookie: gstack_pty=...` is kept as a
fallback for non-browser callers (the cross-port `SameSite=Strict`
cookie path doesn't survive from a chrome-extension origin).

**Cross-pane PTY injection.** The toolbar's Cleanup button and the
Inspector's "Send to Code" action both pipe text into the live claude
PTY via `window.gstackInjectToTerminal(text)`, exposed by
`sidepanel-terminal.js`. No `/sidebar-command` POST — the live REPL is
the only execution surface in the sidebar now.

**`/health` MUST NOT surface any shell-grant token.** It already leaks
`AUTH_TOKEN` to localhost callers in headed mode (a v1.1+ TODO). Don't
make that worse by adding the PTY session token there. PTY auth flows
through `POST /pty-session` only.

**Transport-layer security** (v1.6.0.0+). When `pair-agent` starts an ngrok tunnel,
the daemon binds two HTTP listeners: a local listener (127.0.0.1, full command
surface, never forwarded) and a tunnel listener (locked allowlist: `/connect`,
`/command` with a scoped token + 26-command browser-driving allowlist,
`/sidebar-chat`). ngrok forwards only the tunnel port. Root tokens over the tunnel
return 403. SSE endpoints use a 30-minute HttpOnly `gstack_sse` cookie minted via
`POST /sse-session` (never valid against `/command`). Tunnel-surface rejections go
to `~/.gstack/security/attempts.jsonl` via `tunnel-denial-log.ts`. Before editing
`server.ts`, `sse-session-cookie.ts`, or `tunnel-denial-log.ts`, read
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#dual-listener-tunnel-architecture-v1600) —
the module boundary (no imports from `token-registry.ts` into `sse-session-cookie.ts`)
is load-bearing for scope isolation.

**Unicode sanitization at server egress** (v1.38.0.0+). Every server egress that
ships page-content-derived strings MUST go through `JSON.stringify(payload,
sanitizeReplacer)` for object payloads or `sanitizeLoneSurrogates(body)` for text
bodies. Lone UTF-16 surrogate halves from CDP page content otherwise reach the
Anthropic API as `\uD800`-style escapes and trigger a 400. Wired at four egress
points today: `handleCommandInternal` (HTTP + batch via a sanitizing wrapper around
`handleCommandInternalImpl`) and both SSE producers (`/activity/stream`,
`/inspector/events`). Post-stringify regex is a no-op — `JSON.stringify` has
already escaped the surrogate before regex could match, so the replacer must run
inside the encoding pipeline. Before adding a new SSE/WebSocket writer or HTTP
response in `server.ts`, read
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#unicode-sanitization-at-server-egress-v13800).
`browse/test/server-sanitize-surrogates.test.ts` pins the wiring with invariant
tests, so bypasses fail CI.

**SSE endpoint helper** (v1.51.0.0+). New SSE endpoints in `server.ts` MUST route
through `createSseEndpoint(req, config)` from `browse/src/sse-helpers.ts`. The
helper owns the cleanup contract (abort + enqueue-throw + heartbeat-throw, all
idempotent) and bakes in `sanitizeLoneSurrogates` on every JSON.stringify, so
new subscribers can't accidentally regress either invariant. Inline
`ReadableStream` wiring leaked subscribers when the TCP connection died without
firing `req.signal.abort` (Chromium MV3 service-worker suspend, intermediate
proxy half-close). `/activity/stream`, `/inspector/events`, and `/memory`
(SSE-eligible) all route through it. `browse/test/sse-helpers.test.ts` pins the
cleanup contract.

**CDP session lifecycle** (v1.51.0.0+). Direct `page.context().newCDPSession(page)`
calls outside `browse/src/cdp-bridge.ts` fail CI via the static-grep tripwire in
`browse/test/cdp-session-cleanup.test.ts`. Use `withCdpSession(page, async (s) => {...})`
for one-shot CDP work (try/finally detach) or `getOrCreateCdpSession(page, cache)`
for cached sessions tied to a page's lifetime (close-detach via `Map<page, session>`).
Three sites migrated: cdp-bridge frame events, write-commands archive capture,
cdp-inspector. The helpers prevent the per-session leak class where successful-path
detach happened but error-path detach was missed.

**Setup symlink hardening** (v1.38.0.0+). Every link site in `setup` MUST route
through the `_link_or_copy SRC DST` helper near the `IS_WINDOWS` detection. On
Windows without Developer Mode, plain `ln -snf` produces frozen file copies that
don't refresh on `git pull` — silent staleness across every host adapter. The
helper preserves `ln -snf` on Unix and switches to `cp -R` / `cp -f` on Windows.
`test/setup-windows-fallback.test.ts` enforces a static invariant: a single raw
`ln` call outside the helper body fails CI. Windows users get a one-line note
from `_print_windows_copy_note_once` reminding them to re-run `./setup` after
every `git pull`.

**Sidebar security stack** (layered defense against prompt injection):

| Layer | Module | Lives in |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1-L3 | `content-security.ts` | both server and agent — datamarking, hidden element strip, ARIA regex, URL blocklist, envelope wrapping |
| L4 | `security-classifier.ts` (TestSavantAI ONNX) | **sidebar-agent only** |
| L4b | `security-classifier.ts` (Claude Haiku transcript) | **sidebar-agent only** |
| L5 | `security.ts` (canary) | both — inject in compiled, check in agent |
| L6 | `security.ts` (combineVerdict ensemble) | both |

**Critical constraint:** `security-classifier.ts` CANNOT be imported from the
compiled browse binary. `@huggingface/transformers` v4 requires `onnxruntime-node`
which fails to `dlopen` from Bun compile's temp extract dir. Only `security.ts`
(pure-string operations — canary, verdict combiner, attack log, status) is safe
for `server.ts`. See `~/.gstack/projects/garrytan-gstack/ceo-plans/2026-04-19-prompt-injection-guard.md`
§"Pre-Impl Gate 1 Outcome" for full architectural decision.

**Thresholds** (in `security.ts`):
- `BLOCK: 0.85` — single-layer score that would cause BLOCK if cross-confirmed
- `WARN: 0.75` — cross-confirm threshold. When L4 AND L4b both >= 0.75 → BLOCK
- `LOG_ONLY: 0.40` — gates transcript classifier (skip Haiku when all layers < 0.40)
- `SOLO_CONTENT_BLOCK: 0.92` — single-layer threshold for label-less content classifiers
  (testsavant, deberta). Intentionally higher than `BLOCK` because these layers can't
  distinguish "this is an injection" from "this looks like phishing aimed at the user."
  The transcript classifier keeps a separate, label-gated solo path at `BLOCK` (0.85).

**Ensemble rule:** BLOCK only when the ML content classifier AND the transcript
classifier both report >= WARN. Single-layer high confidence degrades to WARN —
this is the Stack Overflow instruction-writing FP mitigation. Canary leak
always BLOCKs (deterministic).

**Env knobs:**
- `GSTACK_SECURITY_OFF=1` — emergency kill switch. Classifier stays off even if
  warmed. Canary is still injected; just the ML scan is skipped.
- `GSTACK_SECURITY_ENSEMBLE=deberta` — opt-in DeBERTa-v3 ensemble. Adds
  ProtectAI DeBERTa-v3-base-injection-onnx as L4c classifier for cross-model
  agreement. 721MB first-run download. With ensemble enabled, BLOCK requires
  2-of-3 ML classifiers agreeing at >= WARN (testsavant, deberta, transcript).
  Without ensemble (default), BLOCK requires testsavant + transcript at >= WARN.
- Classifier model cache: `~/.gstack/models/testsavant-small/` (112MB, first run only)
  plus `~/.gstack/models/deberta-v3-injection/` (721MB, only when ensemble enabled)
- Attack log: `~/.gstack/security/attempts.jsonl` (salted sha256 + domain only,
  rotates at 10MB, 5 generations)
- Per-device salt: `~/.gstack/security/device-salt` (0600)
- Session state: `~/.gstack/security/session-state.json` (cross-process, atomic)
