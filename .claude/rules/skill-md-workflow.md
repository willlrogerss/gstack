## SKILL.md workflow

SKILL.md files are **generated** from `.tmpl` templates. To update docs:

1. Edit the `.tmpl` file (e.g. `SKILL.md.tmpl` or `browse/SKILL.md.tmpl`)
2. Run `bun run gen:skill-docs` (or `bun run build` which does it automatically)
3. Commit both the `.tmpl` and generated `.md` files

To add a new browse command: add it to `browse/src/commands.ts` and rebuild.
To add a snapshot flag: add it to `SNAPSHOT_FLAGS` in `browse/src/snapshot.ts` and rebuild.

**Token ceiling:** Generated SKILL.md files trip a warning above 160KB (~40K tokens).
This is a "watch for feature bloat" guardrail, not a hard gate. Modern flagship
models have 200K-1M context windows, so 40K is 4-20% of window, and prompt caching
makes the marginal cost of larger skills small. The ceiling exists to catch runaway
preamble/resolver growth, not to force compression on carefully-tuned big skills
(`ship`, `plan-ceo-review`, `office-hours` legitimately pack 25-35K tokens of
behavior). If you blow past 40K, the right fix is usually: (1) look at WHAT grew,
(2) if one resolver added 10K+ in a single PR, question whether it belongs inline
or as a reference doc, (3) only compress carefully-tuned prose as a last resort —
cuts to the coverage audit, review army, or voice directive have real quality cost.

**Merge conflicts on SKILL.md files:** NEVER resolve conflicts on generated SKILL.md
files by accepting either side. Instead: (1) resolve conflicts on the `.tmpl` templates
and `scripts/gen-skill-docs.ts` (the sources of truth), (2) run `bun run gen:skill-docs`
to regenerate all SKILL.md files, (3) stage the regenerated files. Accepting one side's
generated output silently drops the other side's template changes.
